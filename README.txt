A plugin to easily control which menus appear on which pages, using only the built in page parenting of wordpress.

== Description ==

Parent your Pages, the top level parent will be the menu then create. Name menus like so 'Example Menu' slug: 'example-menu' (example being the title of your top level ancestor page) 

This plugin is intended to be used as a standalone system with no options that solely relies on the organization of your pages via Parenting. The plugin grabs the highest level parent page of any page (ancestor) and searches for a user created menu (not theme location!) that matches the top level page.

User created menus should be named as follows:
Title:			
Example Menu

slug:
example-menu

Your naming conventions for menus must utilize this order to make this work.

A few notes about the sections above:



    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `ancestral-menus.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.
